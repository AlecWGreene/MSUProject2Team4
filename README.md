# Avalon Web App 


  
  ## Description 

Avalon is a beloved party game where 5-10 players attempt to complete 5 quests. First, players are anonymously assigned roles which divide them up into heroes of Merlin and minions of Mordred. Then, a random player is chosen to be king. He selects a party to go on the quest, and then the entire group votes to either send the party or the next person be king. To pass a quest, each quest member must vote to pass the quest. This is then repeated until either the heroes win 3 quests or the minions fail 3 quests. However, the minions of Mordred have one last trick up their sleeve. If the heroes complete 3 quests, one of the minions was given the role of assassin and may select who they think is Merlin. If they guess correctly then the minions win. Avalon is much less a game about pieces on a board and about logic, intuition, and social manipulation. Are you up to the challenge?

  ## Usage 

To navigate the site, click on the crown to reveal the navigation buttons. From there, options are presented to either create an empty lobby to invite friends to, or join an existing lobby to meet up with a group using its unique eight character code. From there, once everyone has readied up, the players will be redirected into a game session. Modal windows will appear based on actions available to the player, and a chat window below allows players to communicate and discuss. If a voice system such as discord is available, it's highly recommend to use video chat or voice chat.
